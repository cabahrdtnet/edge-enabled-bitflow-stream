# edge-enabled bitflow
This repository consists of
- a device service for [EdgeX Foundry](https://github.com/edgexfoundry) called ```device-bitflow```
- a wrapper of [bitflow](https://github.com/bitflow-stream/go-bitflow) called ```engine``` to act as a device for ```device-bitflow```

and has been developed by Christian Alexander Bahrdt as part of his bachelor's thesis.
